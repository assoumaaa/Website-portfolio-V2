Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my journey as a software engineer, the challenges I face, the solutions I discover, and the lessons I learn along the way.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Technical tutorials** and deep dives into technologies I work with
- **Project showcases** and behind-the-scenes insights
- **Problem-solving** approaches and debugging experiences
- **Career reflections** and industry observations
- **Open source** contributions and community involvement

## How to Write Your Own Posts

To create a new blog post, simply:

1. Create a new `.mdx` or `.md` file in the `content/blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with metadata:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: "2024-01-15"
   description: "A brief description of your post"
   ---
   ```
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The file name becomes the URL slug (e.g., `my-post.mdx` → `/blog/my-post`)

## Features

This blog supports:

- **Markdown syntax** - Write naturally with Markdown
- **Code highlighting** - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **MDX support** - Use React components in your posts
